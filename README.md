# Samsung Object Erase Port for all Samsung Galaxy
Object Erase ported from One UI 4 ROM to all One UIs

Samsung's Object Erase feature was taken from a One UI 4 ROM and functional in other versions of One UI, also tested in One UI 3.1, here I will make it available for everyone to download and use or put in One UI ROMs

There will be compressed files, unzip them, I did this to get around the 25MB upload limit XD
